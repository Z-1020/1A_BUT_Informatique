/**
 * \mainpage SAE 1.1 and 1.2 for IUT Grand Ouest Normandie, computer science department
 * \section description Description of the SAE
 * This SAE is aimed to implement a two player game.
 * The rules of the games are described below.
 *
 * The project is divided into various files. Mostly, the engine of the game,
 * implementing the detailed rules, is provided in the files board.c and board.h
 *
 * \section rules Detailed rules of the game.
 *
 * \subsection general Simple set of rules
 *
 * The game is played by two players that we call here _north_ and _south_.
 * It is played on a board made of _cells_, 
 * initially cells are organized according to a seven columns by eight lines square grid, 
 * but variants will be proposed.
 *
 * Each player has a single piece, his _king_, that is initially placed on the middle cell
 * of the row closest to his side of the board.
 * 
 * Players alternate turns first moving their king to an adjacent cell, 
 * then killing an unoccupied cell from the board.
 * 
 * If the player's king is unable to move (no living cells remain next to his king's cell),
 * the player looses the game.
 *
 * \subsection variations Variations
 *  
 *  Two alternate versions of the game are proposed:
 *    * the first one, the hex variation, is simply played on a board of hexagonal cells
 *      organized along a diamond whose side is made of five cells.
 *    * the second one, the ranged variation, is a version where each king is 
 *    allowed to kill a cell only if he could have reached it within at most 3 moves.
 *  Of course, both variations can be combined into a hex and ranged game.
 *
 * In hexagonal grids, here are the scheme that the column coordinates are defined :
 *
 * @verbatim
     / \ / \ / \
    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 
   / \ / \ / \ / \
  | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 
 / \ / \ / \ / \ / \
| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |   
 \ / \ / \ / \ / \ /
  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |   
   \ / \ / \ / \ /
    | 2 | 3 | 4 |   
     \ / \ / \ / @endverbatim
